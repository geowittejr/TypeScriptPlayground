###Typings
Get the TypeScript definitions from this repository
https://github.com/typings/typings
https://github.com/typings/typings/blob/master/docs/commands.md


I need a typings.json file that replaces what used to be a tsd.json file (see todomvc app).

###Type Definitions

Now with TypeScript 2.0 we can install type definition files using NPM.
See: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/06/15/the-future-of-declaration-files/
I installed the type definition file for React with this command:

    npm install --save-dev @types/react

###Git

Add Another Remote:

    git remote add remote-name https://remote-url

    git push remote-name master
